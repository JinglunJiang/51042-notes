# 51042-notes

Course notes for 51042 Python Programming.

There are three ways to use these notes:

## Browsing on GitHub

GitHub renders Jupyter notebooks, though they will not be interactive.
You can browse them here on the web but be aware that you won't be able to interact or execute examples.  You can instead copy example code to your REPL and experiment with it there.

## VSCode

If you check this repo out and open it in VS Code the editor will prompt you to install the Jupyter extension.  This will allow you to interact with the notes within your editor.

## Jupyter Lab

In class I present using Jupyter Lab, which is a tool widely used in scientific programming. 
If you don't have Jupyter lab installed, you can install it by running `poetry install` within the checked out directory. 
(If you haven't installed `poetry`, see [installing poetry](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~jturk/mpcs51042/assignments/general/#installing-poetry).

* `poetry install`
* `poetry run jupyter lab`

This will open an interface in your browser that will let you open the individual ipynb files and browse/interact with them the way I do during lectures.
